Hi everybody,

Welcome to my new site! This was a big refresh, as the old site used an archaic HTML Frames design.

This new site is built upon Jekyll, which is a Ruby-based framework for quickly processing Markdown code.


What this means is that I am now able to update my page in a much more timely manner.
Other cool features include Facebook comments (leave me a message!) and easier links to my pages.

It's also less ugly. No more Times New Roman!

I hope you like it!

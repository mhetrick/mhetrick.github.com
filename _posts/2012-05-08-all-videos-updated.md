More improvements. Since the original page push, I've added many features to video pages.


All videos are now embedded directly on the page (no more having to travel to Vimeo or Youtube).

The comment system is now per-page, instead of site-wide.
In addition, all videos now have a Facebook Like button, so you can share pages with your friends.

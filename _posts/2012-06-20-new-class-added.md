Hi everybody. I've updated the site to include work I did for Marcos Novak's generative 3D class this quarter. It features a lot of work that I'm very excited to present!

Also, I've discovered that GitHub doesn't let you add custom headers for auto-refreshing pages. Make sure you manually refresh pages from time to time to get the newest content. 
I'll be switching servers soon because of this!

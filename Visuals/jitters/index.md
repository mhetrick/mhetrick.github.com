<p>&quot;Jitter&quot; is a term used to describe discontinuity in video or audio data.<br />
  <br />
  Jitter is a library of video processing tools in Cycling 74's Max.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;The Jitters&quot; is also a song by The Dismemberment Plan about being alone.<br />
  <br />
This is a video about all of those things, as I've always felt that social anxiety is like a glitch in the human computer (We freeze, lock-up, stutter...). All video was filmed using a webcam, and processed using all-original code in Jitter. All music was made using samples recorded directly in front of the computer--no synthesis.</p>

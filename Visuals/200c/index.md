##About

200C was a class taught by Theodore Kim and David Adams at MAT, Spring 2012.

The focus on the class was pattern formation. We learned how to implement complex 
algorithms, and then how to break them. 

All programs were written in C++. Here are some of the results.

##Week 4: <a href="dla/">Diffusion Limited Aggregation</a>

  <br />
  DrawJong is a chaotic, two-oscillator wave terrain synthesizer based on the De Jong attractor. It is capable of producing wild glitches and weird waveforms, along with a steady stream of gorgeous visuals. <br />
  <br />
  Use it to feed your favorite sampler, to explore new forms of sound, or to create awesome wallpapers (DrawJong is capable of exporting photos to your photo library)! <br />
  <br />
  DrawJong comes with a detailed instruction manual, so people of all skill levels can use it. All controls are laid out to provide the best experience possible. <br />
  <br />
Don't buy another boring synthesizer. Explore DrawJong today.</p>

<p>DrawJong is a continuation of <a href="../594CM/drawjong.html">my final project</a> for an OpenGL class. This version takes all of the features of the Mac version and adds a rich sonification engine based on Lance Putnam's <a href="http://mat.ucsb.edu/gamma/">Gamma</a> library.</p> 
<p>I am extremely proud of this project, and I hope that you enjoy it. </p>
